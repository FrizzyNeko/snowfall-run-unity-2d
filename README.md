# Snowfall Run  (Unity 2D)

**Snowfall Run** is a score-based 2D snowboarding game developed in Unity.  
The player selects a character and rides downhill, performing flips and tricks in mid-air to increase their score while managing speed and risk.

The core gameplay revolves around a **risk–reward system**: attempting more flips yields higher scores, but failing to land safely results in an instant game over.
